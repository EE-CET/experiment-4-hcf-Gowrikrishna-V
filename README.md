# Experiment 4: HCF of Two Numbers

## Problem Statement

Given two numbers $a$ and $b$, find their HCF (Highest Common Factor).
HCF is the greatest common divisor between two numbers.

## Input Format

The first line of input contains the integers $a$ and $b$.

## Output Format

The output should be the HCF of $a$ and $b$.

### Example 1

**Input:**

```text
75 90
```

**Output**
```text
15
```

**Explanation**
$75 = 3 \times 5 \times 5$ and $90 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5$.
So the common factors are $3 \times 5 = 15$.

### Example 2

**Input:**

```text
25 50
```

**Output**
```text
25
```
